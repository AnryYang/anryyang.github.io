I am currently a Research Fellow at the School of Computing, National University of Singapore. I obtained my Ph.D. in computer science from Nanyang Technological University, advised by Prof. [Xiaokui XIAO](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~xiaoxk/) and Prof. [Sourav Saha Bhowmick](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/assourav/). I received my B.E. degree from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. Broadly speaking, my research aims to develop efficient algorithms for big data using sampling, sketching, or indexing techniques.
