I am currently an Assistant Professor with the Department of Computer Science at Hong Kong Baptist University. I earned a Ph.D. in computer science from Nanyang Technological University, followed by a postdoctoral stint at the National University of Singapore. I am a recipient of the 2021 VLDB Best Research Paper Award and the 2022 SIGMOD Research Highlight Award. Broadly speaking, my research focuses on big data science and engineering, which is to develop efficient algorithms and systems for large-scale data management, analysis, mining, and learning. I am also affiliated with [Database Research Group](https://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/~db/) at HKBU.

<!--
> I have one Ph.D. opening starting from 2025 Fall. See details [here](https://renchi.ac.cn/recruit/). Please send [me](mailto:renchi@hkbu.edu.hk) your CV and transcripts, if you are interested.
-->

### Research Interests
- Databases and data management: graph query processing, similarity search 
- The Web and information retrieval: search and ranking, recommendation, web mining, text analytics
- Data mining and machine learning: social network analysis, graph learning, text mining, LLMs

<!-- > I am looking for [Ph.D. students](https://renchi.ac.cn/recruit/), research assistants, and visiting students. Please drop me an email, if you are interested. -->

<!-- UPDATE: I am actively looking for a tenure-track faculty position. Please find my C.V. [here](https://renchi.ac.cn/files/CV.pdf). -->

<!-- I welcome inquiries on potential collaborations on interesting topics. Note that, in the papers, every coauthor needs to make substantial contributions to qualify him/her for authorship, and the order of authors in the byline reflects the magnitude of contribution. -->
