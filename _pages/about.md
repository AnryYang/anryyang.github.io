I am currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Hong Kong Baptist University. I earned a Ph.D. in computer science from Nanyang Technological University, followed by a postdoctoral stint at National University of Singapore. I am a recipient of the 2021 VLBD Best Research Paper Award and the 2022 SIGMOD Research Highlight Award. Broadly speaking, my research aims to develop efficient algorithms and systems for large-scale data management and analysis. I am also a member of [Database Research Group](https://www.comp.hkbu.edu.hk/~db/) at HKBU.

<!-- > I have 2 Ph.D. openings starting from Fall 2023. Please send [me](mailto:renchi@hkbu.edu.hk) your CV and transcripts, if you are interested. -->
<!-- > I am looking for Ph.D. students, research assistants, and visiting students. Please drop me an email, if you are interested. -->

<!-- UPDATE: I am actively looking for a tenure-track faculty position. Please find my C.V. [here](https://renchi.ac.cn/files/CV.pdf). -->
